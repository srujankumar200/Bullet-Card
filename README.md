Bullet Card:

In this short assignment of mine I have covered the topic’s like
* 1 – data(collection/pattern)
* 2 – data preparation (cleaning and formatting)
* 3 – handling null value’s
* 4 – Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
* 5 – Data visualization  

I have completed the following in multiple of the available tool’s namely
* 1 – Kaggle/online data sources – in the aim to collect and process the data (company data), I have also referred to some git repository for the data
* 2 – after collecting the data the very next step is to process it/see the pattern (libraries like pandas,  NumPy, missingno) – Tools like (excel-power query)
* 3 – handling null, duplicate values is one of the most important stuffs for and visualization and not so easy also
* 4 – finally after the data is dealt with they can visualized for a better interpretation and understanding
Lib’s (seaborn, matplot), tools (PowerBI) 

Overview & challenges: 
This assignment allowed me to learn key concepts in data cleaning and dealing with redundant/null values, which in turn have a great effect on the visualization and the data processing 
While this was not all a down-hill path
 
Conclusion:
The sales of company cater to different customer and it is essential to analyse your competitor and learn where to target and lure the audience in terms of selling the products like 
* discount
* combo's
