# Sales-Analysis
Bullet Card:
Comprehensive study of a company sales and analyse the strategy to improve it's sales

In this short assignment of mine I have covered the topic’s like
1 – data(collection/pattern)
2 – data preparation (cleaning and formatting)
3 – handling null value’s
4 – Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
5 – Data visualization  

I have completed the following in multiple of the available tool’s namely
1 – Kaggle/online data sources – in the aim to collect and process the data (company data), I have also referred to some git repository for the data
2 – after collecting the data the very next step is to process it/see the pattern (libraries like pandas,  NumPy, missingno) – Tools like (excel-power query)
3 – handling null, duplicate values is one of the most important stuffs for and visualization and not so easy also
4 – finally after the data is dealt with they can visualized for a better interpretation and understanding
Lib’s (seaborn, matplot), tools (PowerBI) 

Overview & challenges: 
This assignment allowed me to learn key concepts in data cleaning and dealing with redundant/null values, which in turn have a great effect on the visualization and the data processing 
While this was not all a down-hill path
 
I faced my share of challenges, like not getting the right data for the processing and dealing with null values which caused a hiccup and slowed down the process of achieving the goal
